# Greedy

### Suppose the student has a bag that can hold 1.5kg of books. Show step by step how a greedy algorithm would work in choosing books to borrow. Is this optimal?

1. Choose locally optimal, so max possible. Which would be 900g
2. Then again - max possible, which would be 400g, so 7 questions in total

Not optimal as 600 + 400 + 500 is optimal, 9 questions

### Suppose the student finds gets a larger bag that can hold 1.6kg of books. How does the greedy algorithm perform now?

Now they can fit 900g, 400g
